    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <div class="header-info">
        <p>Welcome to Best Trucking Solution Inc. These Terms and Conditions outline the rules and
            regulations for using our services and website. By accessing our services, you agree to comply
            with these terms. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please refrain from using our
            services. These Terms and Conditions govern the use of the services provided by Best Trucking Solution Inc, including freight delivery and access to our website. By engaging with our services,
            you agree to abide by these terms.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Scope of Services</h2>
    <p>Our company specializes in transporting general freight across the United States. We
        work with owner-operators to fulfill transportation needs and provide dispatch services to
        coordinate and secure freight loads. The terms outlined here apply to all aspects of our service
        delivery, including booking, dispatch, and communications. Any special arrangements outside
        the scope of standard services must be agreed upon in writing.
    </p>

    <h2>Owner-Operator Obligations</h2>
    <p>Our company specializes in transporting general freight across the United States. We
        work with owner-operators to fulfill transportation needs and provide dispatch services to
        coordinate and secure freight loads. The terms outlined here apply to all aspects of our service
        delivery, including booking, dispatch, and communications. Any special arrangements outside
        the scope of standard services must be agreed upon in writing.
    </p>

    <h2>Owner-Operator Obligations</h2>
    <p>Owner-operators are independent contractors responsible for maintaining their vehicles,
        securing required licenses, and ensuring compliance with all federal, state, and local
        transportation laws. They must carry the necessary insurance for liability, cargo, and property
        damage as specified in their agreements with Best Trucking Solution Inc. Failure to meet these
        obligations may result in termination of the contractual relationship.

    </p>

    <h2>Dispatch Services</h2>
    <p>Our dispatch services include finding and coordinating loads for owner-operators,
        facilitating communication with brokers and shippers, and providing support during the
        transportation process. Dispatch services are provided under a separate agreement that
        outlines fees, responsibilities, and terms specific to these services.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitations of Liability</h2>
    <p>While we strive to ensure timely and secure delivery, Best Trucking Solution Inc is not
        responsible for delays, losses, or damages caused by factors outside our control, such as
        natural disasters, accidents, or third-party interference. For owner-operators, liability for cargo or
        damages is governed by their independent agreements and insurance coverage.
    </p>

    <h2>Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>By using our services, you consent to the collection and use of your personal and business
        information as outlined in our Privacy Policy. We prioritize the security of your data and comply
        with applicable data protection laws.

    <p>Our services and website may not be used for illegal or unauthorized purposes.
        Customers, owner-operators, and other users are prohibited from engaging in fraudulent
        activities, attempting to breach the security of our systems, or participating in actions that disrupt
        our operations.
    </p>

    <h2>Termination of Services</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to our services at any time without notice if
        you violate these Terms and Conditions or engage in activities deemed harmful to our company
        or other customers. Owner-operator agreements may also be terminated for non-compliance or
        breach of contract.
    </p>
